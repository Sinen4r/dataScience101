Hornberger   As US officials continue to accuse Russia of meddling with the US presidential election, an accusation that they have provided no evidence whatsoever to support, let\\u2019s review some of the US government\\u2019s history of meddling with elections in others countries.1. In 1951, the democratically elected parliament of Iran elected a man named Mohammad Mossadegh to be Iran\\u2019s prime minister. Mossadegh angered British Empire officials by nationalizing British oil interests in the country.British officials then turned to the CIA for assistance. In 1953, the CIA secretly fomented a violent coup in Iran, which succeeded in ousting Mossadegh from power and making the Shah of Iran the supreme unelected dictator of the country.To fortify the Shah\\u2019s dictatorial hold on power, the CIA helped organize and train the his domestic police force, the Savak, which was essentially a combination of the CIA, the NSA, and the military. Part of the CIA\\u2019s training involved teaching Savak agents the art of torture.For the next 26 years, the Iranian people suffered under one of the most brutal and tyrannical dictatorships in the world, one that US officials fully supported and called an ally and friend of the United States.In 1979, Iranians successfully revolted against the Shah\\u2019s regime and ousted him from power. One result was not a restoration of the democratic system that had elected Mossadegh but rather another brutal dictatorship, this time a religious one. Another result is the bad relations between the Iran and US governments that continues to exist today.2. In 1951, the Guatemalan people democratically elected a man named Jacobo Arbenz to be their president. Arbenz, however, was not satisfactory to US officials, especially the national-security branch of the government, specifically the Pentagon and the CIA. The reason that US officials opposed Arbenz was that he was a socialist, and US officials considered a socialist president of Guatemala to be a threat to \\u201cnational security\\u201d here in the United States.In 1954 \\u2014 one year after the coup in Iran, the CIA fomented a violent military coup that succeeded in removing Arbenz from power and replacing him with one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in Latin American history, a man named Carlos Castillo Armas. The CIA had a kill list prepared for the coup, which Arbenz was able to escape by fleeing the country before Castillo was able to get him. The CIA\\u2019s destruction of Guatemala\\u2019s democratic system threw the nation into a 30-year civil war that ended up killing millions of Guatemalan people, especially many of the poor.3. In 1960 a man named Patrice Lamumba was elected Congo\\u2019s first prime minister after independence from Belgium. Lamumba spoke out against Western imperialism and refused to take sides in the Cold War, which caused the CIA to conclude that he was a threat to \\u201cnational security.\\u201d The CIA orchestrated the assassination of Lamumba, which ended up taking place on January 17, 1961, just three days before President Kennedy, who liked Lamumba and who would have ordered the CIA to stand down, was to be sworn into office.4. In 1970 a man named Salvador Allende received a plurality of votes in the presidential election in Chile. Pursuant to the Chilean constitution, the election was thrown into the national congress. President Richard Nixon, his national-security team, the Pentagon, and the CIA concluded that because Allende believed in communism and socialism, he posed a grave threat to \\u201cnational security\\u201d here in the United States. The CIA attempted to bribe members of the congress to vote against Allende. It also orchestrated the kidnapping of the head of Chile\\u2019s armed forces, Gen Rene Schneider, who opposed a US military coup in his country, especially since a coup would violate the country\\u2019s constitution. The kidnapping attempt on Schneider left him dead.The CIA then fomented a coup that took place on 9/11 1973 that violently ousted Allende from power and left him dead. Replacing him was army Gen. Augusto Pinochet, one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in history. By the time Pinochet\\u2019s 17-year reign of military terror came to an end in 1990, he and his CIA-supported goons had incarcerated, raped, tortured, or killed tens of thousands of innocent people \\u2014 that is, people whose only \\u201ccrime\\u201d was believing in socialism \\u2014 with the full support of the CIA, Pentagon, Nixon, and his \\u201cnational security\\u201d team.Of course, there are also the more recent support of regime-change operations that ousted democratically elected presidents that the US government disapproved of, such as in Ukraine and Egypt.And then there is the long list of countries where unelected dictators were targeted for regime change by the US national security state and, where successful, replaced with a brutal unelected pro-US dictator. Cuba, Indonesia, Iraq, Libya, and Syria all come to mind.US officials need to keep in mind that when they point their accusatory index finger at Russia for supposedly meddling in the US presidential election, US officials have, at the same time, three fingers pointing back at themselves.

Well, the three terrorists who attacked London Bridge over the weekend found the Black and Blue Steakhouse, and they found the toughest man in the house. [Or, maybe more to the point, he found them.  Roy Larner, 47, is a huge fan of the South East London soccer team Millwall F. C. The team is known as the Lions, and when   terrorists entered the Black and Blue to kill innocent people, Larner let them know who is the true king of the jungle. After the terrorists entered, with obvious bad intentions, Larner sprang into action: \\u201cLike an idiot I shouted back at them. I thought, \\u2018I need to take the p*** out of these b*****s.\\u2019 \\u201cI took a few steps towards them and said, \\u2018F*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall.\\u2019 So they started attacking me. \\u201cI stood in front of them trying to fight them off. Everyone else ran to the back. I was on my own against all three of them, that\\u2019s why I got hurt so much. It was just me, trying to grab them with my bare hands and hold on. I was swinging. \\u201cI got stabbed and sliced eight times. They got me in my head, chest and both hands. There was blood everywhere. \\u201cThey were saying, \\u2018Islam, Islam!\\u2019 I said again, \\u2018F*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall!\\u2019 \\u201cIt was the worst thing I could have done as they carried on attacking me. \\u201cLuckily, none of the blows were straight at me or I\\u2019d be dead. \\u201d A petition has begun, with the aim of awarding Larner with the George Cross for bravery. The award is the second highest commendation granted by Great Britain. Looking at his scars, it\\u2019s really hard to imagine that he won\\u2019t get it. If Millwall is looking for a new slogan, they may have found it. \\u201cF*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall!\\u201d has a nice ring to it.

Posted on Oct 28, 2016 Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton argued over foreign policy during the third presidential debate. (Screen shot via YouTube ) \\nWe are only 10 days away from Election Day, and the two mainstream candidates are steamrolling through the swing states in an effort to court votes. Over the past week, WikiLeaks provided some revelations on how Clinton and her husband used the Clinton Foundation to their advantage. Donald Trump, meanwhile, continued to close in on Clinton in the polls. \\nThe week began on a somber note, when news broke that longtime peace activist and California legislator Tom Hayden died at age 76. His original Truthdig reports , which have been reposted throughout the week, reinforce the importance of an anti-war foreign policy. \\u201cOur systems\\u2014politics, media, culture\\u2014are totally out of balance today because of our collective refusal to admit that the Vietnam War was wrong and that the peace movement was right,\\u201d he said in 2016 . \\nMany of his reports written back in 2006 focus on American foreign policy in the Middle East. Although written over a decade ago, Hayden\\u2019s words of caution still ring true, as in this piece on a potential U.S. withdrawal from Iraq : \\nMany activists are learning for the first time, or perhaps all over again, what it means to be winter soldiers in a long war. All the wasted lives can never be brought back, all those squandered tax dollars will never be redistributed, true enough. But if the war itself was never going to be a cakewalk, why should ending it be any different? It may still be far from over, with the simmering question of Iran on the immediate horizon. \\nAs Hayden warned, U.S. involvement in the Middle East is far from over, and throughout this election season a new player has entered the arena: Russia. \\nEarlier this week, Trump stated that Clinton, if elected, would cause World War III with Russia. Truthdig contributor Juan Cole argued that \\u201c[s]uperpowers don\\u2019t fight one another in the nuclear age\\u2026[they] fight proxy wars like Vietnam and Afghanistan.\\u201d Cole asserts that Clinton\\u2019s experience as secretary of state will make it easy for her to communicate with the Russian government and the Pentagon alike. \\nOthers, however, don\\u2019t feel too positive about a potential Clinton administration\\u2019s foreign policy. Clinton has proposed a \\u201cno-fly\\u201d zone over Syria as part of her foreign policy plan, alarming security experts . \\nAs Lauren McCauley writes, reports also surfaced this week showing how a Clinton administration \\u201cwill likely usher in a more aggressive, bipartisan foreign policy in the Middle East and beyond.\\u201d She quotes Greg Jaffe: \\nThe Republicans and Democrats who make up the foreign policy elite are laying the groundwork for a more assertive American foreign policy via a flurry of reports shaped by officials who are likely to play senior roles in a potential Clinton White House,\\u201d the Washington Post\\u2019s White House correspondent Greg Jaffe reports. \\nOne such study, published Wednesday by the Center for American Progress (CAP)\\u2014which is run by president Neera Tanden, policy director for Clinton\\u2019s presidential campaign\\u2014recommends the next administration step up its \\u201cmilitary engagement\\u201d amid a more \\u201cproactive and long-term approach to the Middle East.\\u201d \\nBut what of Trump\\u2019s foreign policy? Juan Cole also argued earlier this week that when it comes to Trump\\u2019s assertions on the U.S. presence in the Middle East, \\u201che doesn\\u2019t have the slightest idea of what he is talking about.\\u201d \\nTruthdig\\u2019s own Bill Boyarsky expressed a similar concern in his column this week, labeling Trump \\u201ca threat to democracy.\\u201d \\n\\u201cTrump\\u2019s scorn for the electoral system and democratic institutions is reason enough to fear a Trump presidency,\\u201d Boyarsky writes. \\u201cAdded to that is his racist rabble-rousing against Muslims, those of Mexican descent and other immigrants.\\u201d \\nAnd of course, the discussion on foreign policy doesn\\u2019t solely revolve around just two presidential nominees. This week, NATO urged \\u201call allies to deploy more troops and military equipment to Russia\\u2019s borders\\u201d in a move that Common Dreams staff writer Nika Knight called \\u201cshortsighted.\\u201d \\nThere is also an inherent problem with the American military spending, says William D. Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy. \\u201cThrough good times and bad, regardless of what\\u2019s actually happening in the world, one thing is certain: in the long run, the Pentagon budget won\\u2019t go down,\\u201d he writes. \\u201cAs long as fear, greed, and hubris are the dominant factors driving Pentagon spending, no matter who is in the White House, substantial and enduring budget reductions are essentially inconceivable.\\u201d \\nSo although there are broader, deeply embedded institutional factors responsible for American foreign policy, whoever wins on November 8 will certainly make an impact. Given the events of the past week\\u2014the focus on increased tensions with Russia, and the tightening race between Clinton and Trump\\u2014we turn to you, our readers. Which candidate has a foreign policy position worth pursuing? Will Clinton\\u2019s experience, although \\u201cwar hawkish,\\u201d serve in her favor, or will Trump\\u2019s business acumen serve him better as Commander in Chief? \\nLet us know in the poll below.

Here\\u2019s what you need to know: \\u2022 Little more than a week before Election Day in the United States, the F. B. I. has become enmeshed as never before in a presidential race. Hillary Clinton and her team launched an attack on the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, James B. Comey, after he disclosed that the agency was looking into a batch of messages that could be related to the inquiry into whether she and aides mishandled classified information. The Justice Department obtained a warrant for the messages, on the computer of the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide. Donald J. Trump continued to improve in polls, including in Florida, a state he must win for a chance at the presidency. \\u2022 The shadowy presidential adviser at the center of the South Korea\\u2019s deepening political scandal returned from Europe to apologize for \\u201cwrongdoings\\u201d and pledge to appear before prosecutors. Concerns that she was allowed too much influence in the government prompted protests that pushed President Park   to purge eight aides over the weekend. \\u2022 The Taliban have seized more territory in Afghanistan this year than at any time in their   struggle against the government. Over the last week, scores of Afghan soldiers and at least three army posts surrendered to the militants. The Taliban are increasingly using social media to advertise their victories. \\u2022 Italy is recovering from one of its strongest earthquakes in decades. Search and rescue teams were converging on the stricken area, in the center of the country, where many buildings were damaged and thousands were homeless. No deaths were immediately reported. \\u2022 About 300 million of the world\\u2019s children breathe highly toxic air, according to a United Nations report. More than   of them are in South Asia, where pollution is at least six times levels considered safe. \\u2022 Thousands of fighters are joining   Shiite militias to further Iraq\\u2019s campaign to free the city of Mosul from the Islamic State. The Iraqi military said the total force is now over 40, 000. \\u2022 After we posted a video about women in Saudi Arabia voting and running for office for the first time, nearly 6, 000 Saudi women poured out their hearts about living in a society where male relatives oversee all aspects of their lives. Some said subtle change was in progress, but many spoke of anger and fear. \\u201cI live a lie just so that I wouldn\\u2019t end up getting killed,\\u201d said one. \\u2022 Canada and the European Union signed a trade agreement that counters the widespread   trend. Canada\\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said the deal would show that \\u201ctrade is good for the middle class and those working hard to join it. \\u201d \\u2022 Global trade is slipping. That\\u2019s partly because developed nations are moving toward curbing free trade, and partly because reduced consumption and investment are drags. \\u2022 The five bidders for the assets of the Hanjin Shipping Company\\u2019s route between Asia and the United States have until Nov. 7 to submit final bids. \\u2022 In Manila, a competition between tycoons has given new life to a   project to build a new airport for the capital. \\u2022 Australian leaders are concerned about a mining magnate\\u2019s Chinese partners as the group becomes the only bidder for a swath of land bigger than Portugal. \\u2022 Here\\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \\u2022 The king of Morocco ordered an investigation into the death of a fish vendor who was crushed by a compactor last week while trying to save more than $10, 000 worth of swordfish confiscated by the authorities. His death set off protests that reached the capital, Rabat.

[Global Times] \\u2022 Dozens of people were reported killed in western Yemen after airstrikes by a   military coalition hit a security complex, which included a prison. [The New York Times] \\u2022 Iceland\\u2019s   Pirate Party won second place in a general election, prompting the prime minister to resign. The party aims to pass the first   constitution. [The New York Times] \\u2022 Diwali, the Indian festival of lights, is being commemorated for the first time at the United Nations in recognition of the holiday\\u2019s celebration in member nations around the globe. The Secretariat building in New York will be lit for the holiday through tonight. \\u2022 By elevating President Xi Jinping to the title of \\u201ccore leader,\\u201d Communist Party officials have shown that, willingly or not, they\\u2019ve bowed to his dominance. \\u2022 Pen Sovann, the first prime minister of Cambodia after the brutal Khmer Rouge government, died in the country\\u2019s southern Takeo Province. He was 80. \\u2022 The first   genetic study of Rattus norvegicus, otherwise known as the brown rat, shows that the rodent evolved slowly on the cold, open plains of northern China or Mongolia, and spread globally over the last few centuries  \\u2014   largely thanks to colonialists. When ghosts and witches, Elsas and Spidermen, take the streets tonight, candy might not be the only thing collected after saying \\u201d  . \\u201d Since 1950, orange boxes with a coin slot have gone    with Halloween traditions. The change goes to Unicef, the United Nations Children\\u2019s Fund. And it is all thanks to a Pennsylvania schoolteacher who decided to follow a children\\u2019s parade led by a cow in Philadelphia. The world was still recovering from World War II in the late 1940s when the Reverend Clyde Allison and his wife, Mary Emma Allison, had their three children    not for candy, but soap and clothing for relief efforts in Europe. But the idea to give back on Halloween needed more legs. It found them when Mrs. Allison followed the parade to a department store, where a Unicef booth was taking in donations. That first year, children carried   boxes that were soon replaced with the official orange ones. Over the years the    for Unicef has raised at least $175 million, with funds going toward improving health care, clean water and education. The \\u201cconstructive approach to Halloween,\\u201d a 1955 Times article on Oct. 30 noted, encouraged American youngsters \\u201cto develop the sense of international citizenship responsibility that is essential in today\\u2019s shrinking world. \\u201d Remy Tumin contributed reporting.

Posted on Oct 28, 2016 Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton argued over foreign policy during the third presidential debate. (Screen shot via YouTube ) \\nWe are only 10 days away from Election Day, and the two mainstream candidates are steamrolling through the swing states in an effort to court votes. Over the past week, WikiLeaks provided some revelations on how Clinton and her husband used the Clinton Foundation to their advantage. Donald Trump, meanwhile, continued to close in on Clinton in the polls. \\nThe week began on a somber note, when news broke that longtime peace activist and California legislator Tom Hayden died at age 76. His original Truthdig reports , which have been reposted throughout the week, reinforce the importance of an anti-war foreign policy. \\u201cOur systems\\u2014politics, media, culture\\u2014are totally out of balance today because of our collective refusal to admit that the Vietnam War was wrong and that the peace movement was right,\\u201d he said in 2016 . \\nMany of his reports written back in 2006 focus on American foreign policy in the Middle East. Although written over a decade ago, Hayden\\u2019s words of caution still ring true, as in this piece on a potential U.S. withdrawal from Iraq : \\nMany activists are learning for the first time, or perhaps all over again, what it means to be winter soldiers in a long war. All the wasted lives can never be brought back, all those squandered tax dollars will never be redistributed, true enough. But if the war itself was never going to be a cakewalk, why should ending it be any different? It may still be far from over, with the simmering question of Iran on the immediate horizon. \\nAs Hayden warned, U.S. involvement in the Middle East is far from over, and throughout this election season a new player has entered the arena: Russia. \\nEarlier this week, Trump stated that Clinton, if elected, would cause World War III with Russia. Truthdig contributor Juan Cole argued that \\u201c[s]uperpowers don\\u2019t fight one another in the nuclear age\\u2026[they] fight proxy wars like Vietnam and Afghanistan.\\u201d Cole asserts that Clinton\\u2019s experience as secretary of state will make it easy for her to communicate with the Russian government and the Pentagon alike. \\nOthers, however, don\\u2019t feel too positive about a potential Clinton administration\\u2019s foreign policy. Clinton has proposed a \\u201cno-fly\\u201d zone over Syria as part of her foreign policy plan, alarming security experts . \\nAs Lauren McCauley writes, reports also surfaced this week showing how a Clinton administration \\u201cwill likely usher in a more aggressive, bipartisan foreign policy in the Middle East and beyond.\\u201d She quotes Greg Jaffe: \\nThe Republicans and Democrats who make up the foreign policy elite are laying the groundwork for a more assertive American foreign policy via a flurry of reports shaped by officials who are likely to play senior roles in a potential Clinton White House,\\u201d the Washington Post\\u2019s White House correspondent Greg Jaffe reports. \\nOne such study, published Wednesday by the Center for American Progress (CAP)\\u2014which is run by president Neera Tanden, policy director for Clinton\\u2019s presidential campaign\\u2014recommends the next administration step up its \\u201cmilitary engagement\\u201d amid a more \\u201cproactive and long-term approach to the Middle East.\\u201d \\nBut what of Trump\\u2019s foreign policy? Juan Cole also argued earlier this week that when it comes to Trump\\u2019s assertions on the U.S. presence in the Middle East, \\u201che doesn\\u2019t have the slightest idea of what he is talking about.\\u201d \\nTruthdig\\u2019s own Bill Boyarsky expressed a similar concern in his column this week, labeling Trump \\u201ca threat to democracy.\\u201d \\n\\u201cTrump\\u2019s scorn for the electoral system and democratic institutions is reason enough to fear a Trump presidency,\\u201d Boyarsky writes. \\u201cAdded to that is his racist rabble-rousing against Muslims, those of Mexican descent and other immigrants.\\u201d \\nAnd of course, the discussion on foreign policy doesn\\u2019t solely revolve around just two presidential nominees. This week, NATO urged \\u201call allies to deploy more troops and military equipment to Russia\\u2019s borders\\u201d in a move that Common Dreams staff writer Nika Knight called \\u201cshortsighted.\\u201d \\nThere is also an inherent problem with the American military spending, says William D. Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy. \\u201cThrough good times and bad, regardless of what\\u2019s actually happening in the world, one thing is certain: in the long run, the Pentagon budget won\\u2019t go down,\\u201d he writes. \\u201cAs long as fear, greed, and hubris are the dominant factors driving Pentagon spending, no matter who is in the White House, substantial and enduring budget reductions are essentially inconceivable.\\u201d \\nSo although there are broader, deeply embedded institutional factors responsible for American foreign policy, whoever wins on November 8 will certainly make an impact. Given the events of the past week\\u2014the focus on increased tensions with Russia, and the tightening race between Clinton and Trump\\u2014we turn to you, our readers. Which candidate has a foreign policy position worth pursuing? Will Clinton\\u2019s experience, although \\u201cwar hawkish,\\u201d serve in her favor, or will Trump\\u2019s business acumen serve him better as Commander in Chief? \\nLet us know in the poll below.

Here\\u2019s what you need to know: \\u2022 Little more than a week before Election Day in the United States, the F. B. I. has become enmeshed as never before in a presidential race. Hillary Clinton and her team launched an attack on the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, James B. Comey, after he disclosed that the agency was looking into a batch of messages that could be related to the inquiry into whether she and aides mishandled classified information. The Justice Department obtained a warrant for the messages, on the computer of the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide. Donald J. Trump continued to improve in polls, including in Florida, a state he must win for a chance at the presidency. \\u2022 The shadowy presidential adviser at the center of the South Korea\\u2019s deepening political scandal returned from Europe to apologize for \\u201cwrongdoings\\u201d and pledge to appear before prosecutors. Concerns that she was allowed too much influence in the government prompted protests that pushed President Park   to purge eight aides over the weekend. \\u2022 The Taliban have seized more territory in Afghanistan this year than at any time in their   struggle against the government. Over the last week, scores of Afghan soldiers and at least three army posts surrendered to the militants. The Taliban are increasingly using social media to advertise their victories. \\u2022 Italy is recovering from one of its strongest earthquakes in decades. Search and rescue teams were converging on the stricken area, in the center of the country, where many buildings were damaged and thousands were homeless. No deaths were immediately reported. \\u2022 About 300 million of the world\\u2019s children breathe highly toxic air, according to a United Nations report. More than   of them are in South Asia, where pollution is at least six times levels considered safe. \\u2022 Thousands of fighters are joining   Shiite militias to further Iraq\\u2019s campaign to free the city of Mosul from the Islamic State. The Iraqi military said the total force is now over 40, 000. \\u2022 After we posted a video about women in Saudi Arabia voting and running for office for the first time, nearly 6, 000 Saudi women poured out their hearts about living in a society where male relatives oversee all aspects of their lives. Some said subtle change was in progress, but many spoke of anger and fear. \\u201cI live a lie just so that I wouldn\\u2019t end up getting killed,\\u201d said one. \\u2022 Canada and the European Union signed a trade agreement that counters the widespread   trend. Canada\\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said the deal would show that \\u201ctrade is good for the middle class and those working hard to join it. \\u201d \\u2022 Global trade is slipping. That\\u2019s partly because developed nations are moving toward curbing free trade, and partly because reduced consumption and investment are drags. \\u2022 The five bidders for the assets of the Hanjin Shipping Company\\u2019s route between Asia and the United States have until Nov. 7 to submit final bids. \\u2022 In Manila, a competition between tycoons has given new life to a   project to build a new airport for the capital. \\u2022 Australian leaders are concerned about a mining magnate\\u2019s Chinese partners as the group becomes the only bidder for a swath of land bigger than Portugal. \\u2022 Here\\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \\u2022 The king of Morocco ordered an investigation into the death of a fish vendor who was crushed by a compactor last week while trying to save more than $10, 000 worth of swordfish confiscated by the authorities. His death set off protests that reached the capital, Rabat. [The New York Times] \\u2022 Australia\\u2019s government plans to permanently block all asylum seekers trying to reach the country by boat from ever gaining entry. [Sky News] \\u2022 China sets off on its 33rd Antarctic expedition this week, sending more than 250 people on an icebreaker for months to hunt for a site for its fifth research station. [Global Times] \\u2022 Dozens of people were reported killed in western Yemen after airstrikes by a   military coalition hit a security complex, which included a prison. [The New York Times] \\u2022 Iceland\\u2019s   Pirate Party won second place in a general election, prompting the prime minister to resign. The party aims to pass the first   constitution. [The New York Times] \\u2022 Diwali, the Indian festival of lights, is being commemorated for the first time at the United Nations in recognition of the holiday\\u2019s celebration in member nations around the globe. The Secretariat building in New York will be lit for the holiday through tonight. \\u2022 By elevating President Xi Jinping to the title of \\u201ccore leader,\\u201d Communist Party officials have shown that, willingly or not, they\\u2019ve bowed to his dominance. \\u2022 Pen Sovann, the first prime minister of Cambodia after the brutal Khmer Rouge government, died in the country\\u2019s southern Takeo Province. He was 80. \\u2022 The first   genetic study of Rattus norvegicus, otherwise known as the brown rat, shows that the rodent evolved slowly on the cold, open plains of northern China or Mongolia, and spread globally over the last few centuries  \\u2014   largely thanks to colonialists. When ghosts and witches, Elsas and Spidermen, take the streets tonight, candy might not be the only thing collected after saying \\u201d  . \\u201d Since 1950, orange boxes with a coin slot have gone    with Halloween traditions. The change goes to Unicef, the United Nations Children\\u2019s Fund. And it is all thanks to a Pennsylvania schoolteacher who decided to follow a children\\u2019s parade led by a cow in Philadelphia. The world was still recovering from World War II in the late 1940s when the Reverend Clyde Allison and his wife, Mary Emma Allison, had their three children    not for candy, but soap and clothing for relief efforts in Europe. But the idea to give back on Halloween needed more legs. It found them when Mrs. Allison followed the parade to a department store, where a Unicef booth was taking in donations. That first year, children carried   boxes that were soon replaced with the official orange ones. Over the years the    for Unicef has raised at least $175 million, with funds going toward improving health care, clean water and education. The \\u201cconstructive approach to Halloween,\\u201d a 1955 Times article on Oct. 30 noted, encouraged American youngsters \\u201cto develop the sense of international citizenship responsibility that is essential in today\\u2019s shrinking world. \\u201d Remy Tumin contributed reporting.
